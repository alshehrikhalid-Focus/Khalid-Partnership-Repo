**Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.** 

Market research 

By using AI to summarise information about potential competitors/partners 

The AI help me quickly:

* Scan large amounts of public information  
* Identify patterns (target audiences, positioning..etc)  
* Generate a structured shortlist of potential partners

This reduced the time spent on manual scanning and allowed me to focus more on analysis and prioritisation.

## **Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?** 

I asked Ai to conduct a market research focusing on bear competitor FREEDOM App.

The response was

### **Critical Review**

1\. Fact checking:

* Some claims about features (e.g. cross-device sync, locked mode, scheduling depth) were inferred from secondary sources, not from official website for more accurcy

* Pricing ranges for both were approximate and did not mention weather AUD or USD, so they should be verified directly on the pricing page from the official website.

* A few competitor comparisons relied on blog reviews rather than primary sources, which introduces bias.

2\. Editing required

* Some sections repeated ideas (e.g. strengths vs positioning) and required consolidation.

**3\. What worked well**

* Clear structure and logical flow.

* Useful feature-by-feature comparison.

* Strong initial market positioning insights.

**4\. What I would improve next time**

* Cross-check all feature claims against **official product pages**.

* Label assumptions clearly when data is inferred.

* Keep outputs shorter and more decision-focused for internal use.

**Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**

When I use AI tools at Focus Bear, I’ll treat the output as a starting point, not a final answer – like what I’ve done in the critical review for Freedom App research

For example, when I used AI to research Freedom App as a competitor, the initial output was helpful in structuring the analysis and highlighting key features. However, once I reviewed it closely, I noticed that some details (such as feature comparisons and pricing ranges) needed verification.

I had to edit the content, fact-check claims against official sources, and simplify the insights so they were actually useful 

Based on this experience, my best practice is to always review, verify, and refine AI work before using it. I will:

* Check key facts against official product websites   
* Clearly flag assumptions instead of presenting them as facts  
* Don’t rely on weak sources like Wikipedia
