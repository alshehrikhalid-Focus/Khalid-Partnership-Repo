# Research & Learn

**How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**

A Kanban board is a visual way to manage tasks by showing them in different stages of progress. Tasks move from one column to another as work progresses, which helps track status, stay organised, and focus on completing work step by step.

**What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)**

Each column represents a stage of work. Backlog or Not Started shows tasks that have not begun, In Progress shows tasks currently being worked on, Blocked shows tasks that cannot move forward, and Done or Approved shows tasks that are fully completed.

**How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**

Tasks move from left to right across the board as their status changes. I am responsible for updating the task status to reflect the actual progress of my work.

**What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

Limiting work in progress helps reduce overload, improves focus, and increases the chance of finishing tasks efficiently instead of working on too many things at once.

# Reflection

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

Kanban makes all tasks visible and encourages working on a small number of tasks at a time, which helps prioritise important work and avoid taking on too much at once.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I can improve my workflow by limiting the number of tasks in progress, updating task statuses regularly, and focusing on finishing tasks before starting new ones.

# Task

**Create a kanban board for your repo with relevant columns (e.g. not started, in progress, ready for review, approved by bot)**

I created a Kanban board in my repository with relevant columns to represent different stages of work.

**Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.**

I moved at least one task through the Kanban board from not started to in progress and then to ready for review, updating its status to reflect the work done.

**Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.**

One way I can improve task tracking is by updating the Kanban board immediately whenever a task’s status changes so progress is always clear.
