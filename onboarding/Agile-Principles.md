**What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?**  
 Agile is a way of working that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Work is delivered in small, iterative steps, allowing teams to adapt quickly based on feedback and changing priorities. Traditional project management, such as Waterfall, follows a linear process with fixed plans, timelines, and scopes defined upfront. Agile differs by being adaptive, people-focused, and responsive to change rather than strictly plan-driven.

**What are the core values and principles of Agile?**  
 Agile is based on values from the Agile Manifesto, including prioritising individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working solutions over excessive documentation, customer collaboration over rigid agreements, and responding to change over following a fixed plan. Core principles include continuous delivery of value, welcoming change, close team collaboration, and regular reflection to improve ways of working.

**What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?**  
 Scrum organises work into fixed-length sprints, usually one to two weeks, with defined roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner. Work is planned at the start of each sprint and remains mostly fixed until the sprint ends. Scrum is best used when work has clear goals and deliverables.  
 Kanban focuses on continuous workflow rather than time-based sprints. Tasks are pulled as capacity allows, priorities can change at any time, and work is visualised to improve flow and limit overload. Kanban is best used for ongoing, evolving work.

**Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?**  
 Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it offers greater flexibility and supports continuous, asynchronous work. Kanban allows tasks to be reprioritised easily without waiting for sprint cycles, which suits a small, fast-moving team where priorities may change frequently.

**What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**  
 The biggest benefits of Agile include adaptability, faster feedback, improved collaboration, and clear visibility of work. Agile helps teams respond quickly to change and continuously improve.  
 The main challenges include the need for strong communication and self-management. With less rigid structure, Agile can feel unclear if priorities are not well communicated, and teams must be disciplined to avoid taking on too much work at once.

**How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**  
 Agile principles help me stay aligned with changing priorities and respond quickly to feedback. Breaking work into smaller tasks improves focus and progress, while transparent workflows support better collaboration with the team. This approach helps me contribute more effectively and adapt as priorities shift.

**Tasks**

**Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.**

Scrum uses fixed sprints, defined roles, and planned commitments, making it suitable for structured work with clear deadlines. Kanban focuses on continuous delivery, flexible task flow, and visualising work, making it more suitable for ongoing and evolving tasks.

**Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.**

The Agile principle that will be most useful in my work is responding to change over following a plan. This principle allows me to stay flexible, adapt quickly to feedback, and focus on delivering value rather than rigidly sticking to initial assumptions.
