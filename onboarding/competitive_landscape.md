# **Competitive Landscape** 

# **Focus Bear vs Other Productivity Apps**

## **Apps Reviewed**

Focus Bear was compared with the following productivity tools:

* Freedom

* Cold Turkey

* Tiimo

* Routinery

## **Overview of Each App**

## **Focus Bear**

##  Focus Bear combines routine enforcement, distraction blocking, and focus sessions into one system. It is designed primarily for people who struggle with executive functioning, especially those with ADHD. The app actively guides users through routines rather than only sending reminders.

**Freedom**  
Freedom focuses almost entirely on blocking distracting websites and apps across multiple devices. It is effective for users who already know what they need to do but want fewer digital distractions.

**Cold Turkey**

Cold Turkey is a highly rigid blocking tool. Once a block is active, it is very difficult to bypass. It is useful for users who want strict enforcement but offers little support for habits or routines.

**Tiimo**

Tiimo is a visual planning app designed specifically for people with ADHD and Autism. It helps users understand time through visual timelines and structured planning but does not strongly enforce follow-through.

**Routinery**

Routinery focuses on guiding users step-by-step through daily routines. It works well for habit execution but does not include distraction blocking or focus enforcement.

## **What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**

Focus Bear stands out because it combines routine guidance, distraction blocking, and focus sessions into a single workflow.

Most competing apps focus on only one area:

* Freedom and Cold Turkey focus mainly on blocking

* Tiimo focuses on planning

* Routinery focuses on executing routines

Focus Bear enforces routines by actively guiding users through them and limiting access to distractions until they are completed. This makes it more effective for users who struggle with follow-through rather than motivation alone.

## **If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

I would choose Focus Bear if my main challenge was executive dysfunction, not just distraction.

Specifically:

* It prevents starting the day with unplanned phone or app usage.

* Cross-device blocking reduces the habit of switching devices when focus drops.

* Built-in break prompts support sustainable focus instead of burnout.

If I only needed strict blocking, Cold Turkey might be a better option.  
 If I mainly wanted visual planning, Tiimo might be more suitable.  
 However, for structured daily accountability, Focus Bear provides a more complete system.

## **What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**

A clear gap is visual planning and task breakdown, which Tiimo does well.

Tiimo uses visual timelines that make time easier to understand and offers tools that help break vague tasks into smaller steps. Focus Bear is strong at enforcing action but less supportive during the early planning stage of unclear or overwhelming tasks.

## **Based on your research, what’s one improvement Focus Bear could make?**

A possible improvement would be a gentler onboarding experience.

Focus Bear can feel rigid for new users. Introducing a “Gentle Start” mode that gradually increases routine enforcement over the first one or two weeks could help new users adapt without feeling overwhelmed, while still preserving the app’s core accountability approach.
