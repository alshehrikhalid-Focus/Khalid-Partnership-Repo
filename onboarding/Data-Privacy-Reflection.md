**Reflection**

How I will ensure secure data handling in my daily tasks  
To handle data securely, I will:  
\- Be conscious of what data I access and why    
\- Avoid sharing screenshots or files that contain user or internal data    
\- Use strong passwords and keep my accounts secure    
\- Ask for clarification whenever I am unsure about handling data  

\---

**How sensitive information should be stored, shared, and disposed of**  
\- Storage: Only within approved Focus Bear systems    
\- Sharing:Only with authorised team members and only when necessary    
\- Disposal: Removing access and deleting data once it is no longer required

**Common causes of data privacy issues and how to avoid them**  
Common issues include:  
\- Oversharing information in messages or screenshots    
\- Using personal tools or accounts for work-related data    
\- Accessing data without a clear purpose  

These can be avoided by following the need-to-know principle, double-checking before sharing, and asking questions when unsure.

**Habit and Security Measure I Will Implement**

Habit I will adopt to improve data security  
To improve data security in my role, I will adopt the habit of pausing before accessing, storing, or sharing any data and asking myself:

\- Do I actually need this data to complete my task?  
\- Am I using an approved Focus Bear tool or system?  
\- Am I sharing this information only with the right, authorised person?

This habit helps reduce unnecessary access, accidental sharing, and misuse of sensitive information.

**Key learning or security measure I will implement**

A key learning from reviewing Focus Bear’s Privacy Policy is that data privacy is not only a legal requirement but also essential for maintaining user trust and protecting the company.

As a security measure, I will treat all user and internal information as confidential by default and follow the principle of least access — only viewing or handling data when it is clearly required for my work.
