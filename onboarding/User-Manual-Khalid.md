### **Research & Learn**

**What is a “User Manual for Me”, and why do teams use them?**

A “User Manual for Me” is a short personal document that explains how someone works best. Teams use it to improve collaboration, set clear expectations, and reduce friction caused by different working styles.

**What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)**

Helpful categories include communication style, work habits, focus preferences, feedback preferences, collaboration style, and personal quirks or boundaries. These categories help teammates know how to interact and work together more effectively.

**How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?**

It helps teammates understand preferences upfront instead of guessing. This reduces miscommunication, avoids unnecessary frustration, and creates a more respectful and productive working environment.

### **Reflection**

**What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)**

I need clear expectations, direct communication, and genuine respect. Clarity and encouragement help me feel confident and productive, especially when learning something new.

**How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)**

I prefer clear written communication with proper context. I’m happy to jump on meetings when they are useful and have a clear purpose.

**What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)**  
Unclear expectations and pressure affect my focus negatively. I work best when tasks are well defined and I have time to understand what is expected. I usually perform best around noon.

**How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)**

I appreciate gentle, specific feedback with clear examples. Encouragement alongside feedback helps me improve faster. A dismissive tone makes it harder for me to perform well.

**What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)**

I need time to warm up and understand all angles of what I’m working on. I prefer written instructions and may ask questions to make sure I’m doing things correctly.
