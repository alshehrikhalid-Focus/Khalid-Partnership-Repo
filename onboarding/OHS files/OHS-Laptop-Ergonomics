# Khalid’s OHS Learning and Adjustments

## Research & Learn

***What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?***

laptops are not suitable for long work hours due to their fixed design. The risks of prolonged use can be divided into:

### Health risks:

* Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) \-- includes text neck and wrist and hand issues  
* Computer vision syndrome – e.g dry eye, blurred vision, and eye fatigue.   
* Men fertility concerns 


### Productivity Risks:

* Increased error rate due to using a small keyboard.  
* Decreased productivity due to only one small screen without a monitor

***What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)***

* *Laptop stands – raise laptop screen to eye level*  
* *Mouse & Keyboards – for natural arms/wrist positioning*  
* *Adjustable chair*  
* *Lumbar cushion (if chair lacks support)*  
* *Foot rest (if chair is high and foot doesn’t rest flat on the floor)*

***What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?***

### Monitor Height:

* *The top of screen should be just below the eye sight level to keep them the neck natural*  
* *Should be positioned around the arm’s length away (50 cm)*  
* *Should be directly in front of me*   
* *The monitor can be tilted a little bit to avoid reflection*


### Chair Position:

* *Adjust the chair so the feet rest flat on floor and knees are parallel with about a 90-Degrees angle*  
* *Sit back fully on chair curve to support the lumbar*  
* *Relaxed shoulders with elbows bend at 90-degrees close to my body*

### Desk setup:

* *The desk height should allow my forearms to be parallel on the floor when they’re typing*  
* *Ensure enough space for the legs – Cleared legroom with no obstructions*  
* *I should keep the keyboard and mouse close together as the same height as my elbow*

***What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)***

* *Frequent breaks (stretch or move after 20-30 minutes)*  
* *For the eye strain reduction:* 

*1- Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at an object at least 20 feet (6 meters) away for a minimum of 20 seconds.* 

*2- Blink actively*

## Reflection

***What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)***

- *After what I've learned, I will consider using an external monitor to reduce my eye strain, since this’s one of the issues I have.*  
- *I will make sure my chair support my lumbar or adjustable \- so my posture is on the right position and my lumbar is fully supported*


***What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)***

To improve my posture, I: 

* Sit upright and check my posture regularly   
* Take frequent breaks and stretches every 20–30 mins   
* Make sure my feet rest flat on the floor 

*To reduce eye strain, I:* 

* Practice the 20 \- 20 \- 20 rule (every 20 mins, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds)   
* Blink actively 

Also, I adjusted my screen to just below eye level by using my laptop stand, which helps reduce strain by lowering fatigue and keeping my neck in a natural position.

***How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks\!)***

To remind myself, I: 

I use Focus Bear micro breaks to schedule regular breaks.

I have already:

* Schedule movement breaks every 25 mins for 1.30 mins   
* Schedule another reminder every 25 mins for 10 secs to check my posture 

I’ll, also, try to pair movement breaks with simple habits, such as: 

* moving and drinking water   
* Stretch my back and neck during breaks or;  
* Practice breathing during movement breaks

**Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. *(Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks\!)***

To set posture and movement reminders, I:

*  Use Focus Bear micro breaks throughout workday  
*  Schedule movement breaks every 25 mins for 1.30 mins  
*  Schedule posture check reminders every 25 mins for 10 secs

As a result, I noticed:

* Better awareness of my posture during the day  
* More regular movement  
* Less stiffness in my neck and back

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

I use a laptop holder with external keyboard and mouse, and adjustable chair to raise my screen to eye level and improve my posture and wrist position.
