# Research & Learn

**What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?**  
 Common threats include phishing emails, malicious links, weak or reused passwords, unsecured Wi-Fi networks, malware, and unauthorized access to unlocked devices. Remote work increases exposure because people often work from home or public spaces.

**What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?**  
 Best practices include using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), keeping devices and software updated, locking devices when away, avoiding suspicious links, and using secure networks.

**Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?**  
 Locking your computer prevents unauthorized access to company data and systems. Even a short absence can allow someone to view or misuse sensitive information if the device is left unlocked.

**How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?**  
 Suspicious emails or links should not be clicked. The sender and content should be carefully checked, especially if the message creates urgency or asks for login details. If unsure, the safest option is to ignore or report it.

**What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?**  
 A strong password is long, unique, and difficult to guess, using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Using a password manager helps generate and securely store strong passwords, reducing the risk of reuse or forgetting passwords.

**Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?**  
 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step. It should be enabled on all work-related accounts, especially email, GitHub, and internal tools.

# Reflection

**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**  
 I use strong, unique passwords stored in Apple Passwords and avoid clicking suspicious links. I can improve by regularly reviewing account security settings and ensuring 2FA is enabled on all work-related accounts.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**  
 By relying on built-in system protections such as automatic screen locking, Apple Passwords, and 2FA, secure behaviour becomes part of my daily workflow rather than something I need to think about actively.

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**  
 I will continue using Apple Passwords to generate and store strong passwords, enable 2FA wherever possible, and review account security settings regularly.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**  
 I would immediately change affected passwords using Apple Passwords, review account activity, log out of all sessions if possible, and notify the Focus Bear team so the issue can be investigated.

# Task

**Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.**  
 I reviewed my work accounts and confirmed that strong passwords generated and stored in Apple Passwords are used, and that two-factor authentication is enabled where available.

**Review your password storage method—if you’re not using a password manager, consider setting one up.**  
 I reviewed my password storage method and confirmed that I use Apple Passwords as my password manager to securely store and manage my credentials.

**Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes**  
 I configured my computer and phone to automatically lock after a short period of inactivity using a password or biometric authentication.

**Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.**  
 Before accessing, storing, or sharing any data, I will pause to confirm that I need this information and that I am logged in on a secure, locked device.
