# **\#5 Try out the Focus Bear app notes**

**First-Time User Onboarding Review**

## **Context**

I tested the Focus Bear app from a **first-time user onboarding perspective**, focusing on early setup, first interactions, and initial usage without prior guidance.

Although my account was created earlier, I approached this task as if I had just discovered the app for the first time and was trying to understand how it works independently.

The purpose of these notes is to document anything that felt **confusing, frustrating, or unclear** during first-time use, supported by screenshots.

## **Point 1: AI Not Enabled and Focus Alignment Score Shows 0%**

**Screenshot name:** `01_ai_not_enabled_focus_alignment_0.png`

As a first-time user, it was confusing to see the Focus Alignment Score showing 0% while the app indicated that AI was not enabled. There was no explanation of what the Focus Alignment Score represents, whether AI must be enabled for it to function, or what steps are required to activate it. This made it unclear whether the score was expected behavior or the result of incomplete setup.

## **Point 2: App Quits After Postponing Break Multiple Times**

**Screenshot name:** `02_postpone_break_app_quits.png`

When postponing a break notification for the second or third time, the app unexpectedly quit and closed from the dock. After reopening, the app resumed on the break countdown without explaining what had happened. From a first-time user perspective, this was frustrating and confusing because it was unclear whether the focus session or progress had been saved.

## **Point 3: Completed Tasks Still Appear in the To-Do Player**

**Screenshot name:** `03_completed_task_still_in_todo_player.png`

After marking a task as completed, the same task continued to appear in the To-Do Player. As a new user, this created uncertainty about whether the task had actually been completed or whether additional action was required. The lack of immediate update reduced confidence in task tracking.

## **Point 4: Habit Packs Based on Public Figures Lack Explanation**

**Screenshot name:** `04_habit_packs_public_figures_unclear.png`

As a first-time user, I found the “inspired” habit packs based on public figures (for example, Albert Einstein Inspired Habit Pack) confusing because there is no explanation of what specific habits are included (in the app) or referral to the website, how they were derived, or what benefit a user should expect from following them. It was unclear whether these packs are educational, motivational, or simply themed, which made it difficult to understand their value.

## **Point 5: Browser Permissions Impact Is Unclear**

**Screenshot name:** `05_browser_permissions_unclear.png`

In the permissions section, some browsers show “Enabled” while others require permission. As a first-time user, it was unclear which permissions are required for the app to function correctly and whether missing permissions affect features such as focus blocking, alignment scores, or overall functionality. The app does not clearly explain the impact of not enabling certain browsers.

---

## **Summary**

Overall, the app feels powerful, but during first-time use there were several moments where missing explanations, unexpected behavior, or lack of clarity created uncertainty. Improving transparency around setup, feature behavior, and user feedback would significantly improve the onboarding experience for new users.
