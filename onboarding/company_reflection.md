***Why do you think Focus Bear was created?***

* Created because the founder personally struggled with productivity and habits and wanted to help himself and others to reduce procrastination and doomscrolling in a practical way  
* The app built from lived experience as the founder is a diagnosed AuDHD (autistic+ADHD) person  
* The founder found out the productivity and blocking tools didn’t work consistently for neurodivergent people like him.   
* So, out of desperation, from the difficulty of maintaining productivity, which led the founder to combining the best features from other apps into one tool – It’s called Focus bear  
* As a result: The founder created Focus bear to support habits – when motivation and willpower are not enough

***What problem is Focus Bear solving?***

Distractions and focus, and they include:

* Difficulty staying focused due to distractions   
* Procrastination and doomscrolling  
* Inconsistent routines   
* difficulty forming habits  
* Executive dysfunction (knowing what to do, but not doing it)  
* Overstimulation from notifications and apps

***Why do you think this mission is important?***

* When these problems are not supported, it becomes hard for students or workers to manage their daily lives. Some may drop out of uni or get fired. This shows that the issue isn’t only individual, but also societal.  
* Productivity struggles can affect mental health by increasing self-doubt and anxiety, and in some cases may lead to depression.  
* These struggles can also lower self-esteem, as people may feel they are not good enough or always failing.  
* Academic performance can be affected when students struggle with focus, routines, and deadlines.  
* Neurodivergent-friendly tools matter because they support inclusion and fairness by helping different people work in ways that suit them.  
* Gentle structure is better than punishment or shame because it supports better mental health and reduces stress.  
* Sustainable habits matter because they help people function long-term without burnout.

***How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?***

* Focus Bear aligns with my values because I care more about mental health, balance, and people's feelings than productivity alone.  
* I value having structure, but also leaving space for flexibility, creativity, and improvisation.  
* I strongly relate to the idea of focus bear’s philosophy of gentle guidance instead of punishment or pressure.  
* I am interested in wellbeing and mental health, and I have seen how the right support can help people function better at work and study.  
* From my own experience, this became very clear when my dad passed away during the first month of starting my Master’s degree.  
* My uni supported me well during that time, which helped me get back on track with my studies.  
* As someone with PTSD, I strongly believe that without university and psychologist support, I could’ve dropped out of unimelb or failed.

***Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?***

* As someone diagnosed with PTSD, I have personally struggled with focus, procrastination, doomscrolling, and sticking to routines  
* I have also seen many friends and classmates struggle with similar issues, especially during uni  
* Before my diagnosis, I did not fully understand how much PTSD was affecting my studies, which shows that many people struggle even without knowing the reason.  
* I relate to the need for external structure rather than relying on motivation alone, and I already use tools like TickTick and Brain.fm to support my focus and routines— Now I added focus bear to my kit
